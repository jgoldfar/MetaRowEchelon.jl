# MetaRowEchelon #

This is an experiment in metaprogramming Julia for the automated solution of (well-posed) multiple assignments in the form of linear equations. Basically, the question is: can Gaussian elimination be computed ahead-of-time, and if so, should it be?

While I have possible applications in mind, right now the amount of copy/paste and general effectiveness suggest it should be considered a very rough WIP.
